# Simple Unix Shell

A shell is a tool that allows users to access their computer's operating system services through a simple interface. The shell allows us to control our computer by commands typed on our keyboards rather than using a GUI. One of the main benefits of a shell is that you can perform operations that you generally cannot perform using the GUI, for example, deleting locked files.
The simple shell that I have created here was done in order to achieve a deeper understanding of process control and signaling, specifically in C.

 
## Getting Started

In order to run the Simple Unix Shell, firstly, you must clone the repository on your local machine. You can do this by running the following line on your machine's CLI:
